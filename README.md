# Knob Control
Yet another Knob Control in C#

This code is forked from Frabrice Lacharme repository HERE : https://github.com/fabricelacharme/KnobControl.

It's a customization of the knob control that makes it less versatile but fits exactly my needs;
it makes it "multi turn", so you can define a maximum and a minimum value, a "step" to increase and decrease
of a certain amount, and move it with cursor keys, mouse wheel or dragging the mouse up and down while holding the left button.

There's also a sample application that shows how it looks and works.

Obviouly, as it's a multi turn knob, there will be no numeric values written around the knob.
